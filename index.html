                    <p id="bio">
                        I'm Cullen: a recent graduate of University of Oregon. At the moment I'm just saving money and working on building the perfect rig. When I'm not grinding and hustling, I like to work with my house plants. I have six... wait... ten... I think. Anyways they're all pretty cool guys. I also do a lot of reading when I feel like it and some writing too. Mostly just prose, but I do a little poetry as well. I'm always looking for new recs on art, writing, sci-fi and TV. Sometimes I do computer animation, but it's a very time consuming hobby, so I'm rusty.

                                    For a summer I worked as an intern for a media company in Tokyo. I published articles, promoted them via cross-site advertising and even managed a few interns myself. There were three of them, all students from the local University. I edited their articles and helped them post them.

                                    While in college, I helped out with maintenance and events at a local project space. We worked with artists both domestic and international, and hosted openings for their work. In between shows, we maintained the space by painting, plastering, patching, and cleaning. Other days, while the show was open to the public, we sat in the gallery and helped visitors with information and direction.
